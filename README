Other approaches
-----------------

If you want more protection than what safe-rm can offer, here are a few suggestions.

You could of couse request confirmation everytime you delete a file by putting this in
your /etc/bash.bashrc:

  alias rm='rm -i'

But this won't protect you from getting used to always saying yes, or from accidently
using 'rm -rf'.

Or you could make use of the Linux filesystem "immutable" attribute by marking (as root)
each file you want to protect:

  chattr +i file

Of course this is only usable on filesystems which support this feature.

Here are two projects which allow you to recover recently deleted files by trapping
all unlink(), rename() and open() system calls through the LD_PRELOAD facility:
