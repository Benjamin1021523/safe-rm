Manual test suite before a release

- remove only /etc/safe-rm.conf and try to delete a missing file
- remove /etc/safe-rm.conf and ~/.safe-rm and try to delete a missing file
- remove /etc/safe-rm.conf and ~/.safe-rm and try to delete /usr/lib (should fail)
- remove only ~/.safe-rm and try to delete a missing file

- remove a missing file and make sure the return value is nonzero
- touch a file and delete it
- attempt to delete (as a normal user) /usr/lib (which is in /etc/safe-rm.conf)
- attempt to delete a directory which is in ~/.safe-rm without using "-r"

- delete the root directory (/)
- delete a protected path in the current directory using the absolute name
- delete a protected path in the current directory using just the relative filename
- delete a protected path in the current directory using the filename prefixed by ./
- delete a protected path in the current directory using ../dir/filename

- run "safe-rm --help" and make sure it returns the rm usage

- put /home/* in ~/.safe-rm and run "rm /home/*"
- put several files in as arguments, one of which should be skipped, check that the other ones are deleted

- symlink /usr/lib into the current directory and delete the symlink (it should work)

- run "man safe-rm" and skim the manual for obvious mistakes
